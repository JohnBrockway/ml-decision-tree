# ml-decision-tree
A Java implementation of one method to build an optimal (in terms of depth) decision tree. Uses a contrived example of classifying colic horses based on a number of medical metrics.

Uses the given horseTrain.txt and horseTest.txt files to train and test on respectively; to run, execute the following commands in the src directory:
```
javac *.java
java HorseDecisionTree
```
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) for more information on decision tree learning.

As an aside, the tree generated by the given horseTrain.txt file is as follows:
```
                   endotoxin
                       /\
             < 13.425 /  \ > 13.425
                     /    \
                    k     colic
                   /\
           < 3.55 /  \ > 3.55
           ______/    \______
          /                  \
         Na                   GLDH
         /\                    /\
< 141.5 /  \ > 141.5  < 24.65 /  \ > 24.65
       /    \                /    \
    colic  healthy       colic   healthy
```
